Spartan Personal Finance Tool

10/23/2020
The primary original purpose of the "Spartan Personal Finance Tool" Project was to create a simple, yet all-encompassing, snapshot of a user's current personal 
  financial details. The secondary purpose of the project was to improve and solidify the creator's SQL and SQLite skills and knowledge. Since successfully
  accomplishing both the primary and secondary goals, the project has changed slightly. A monthly costs & income calculator was added and integrated into the 
  financial snapshot. This gives the user the abilty to track monthly costs and income and easily see whether they are running at a monthly deficit or a surplus.
  By integrating this function into the overall financial snapshot, accessed in the software by the "net" or "net worth" commands, the user can now see their
  current financial situation as well as understand what their monthly cashflow look like.
